        "<b>GUIDELINES:</b><br><b>ARENA:</b><br>The game field consists of an arena whose dimensions will be announced later. It consists of the following: <br>1. The arena is composed of random paths made up of black stripes. All the distances are shown in the figure. <br>2.  The angle between two adjacent black lines in the path is 90°. <br>3. The width of all black stripes will be 2cm. <br>4.  A black box is present at the end zone of the arena to indicate the end position. <br><b>CHECKPOINTS:</b><br>1. The checkpoints are shown in the figure. (There would not be any blue (coloured). <br>2.  circle in the arena as shown in the figure. They are used only for reference) Each checkpoint carries 25 Points. <br>3. Number of checkpoints and their locations may vary in the actual arena. <br><b>GAMEPLAY:</b><br>The game play consists of two parts: <br>The first part is the “Dry Run.” <br>1.  In this run, the bot must start from the ‘Start’ and find its way to reach the ‘End’ (White box Indicated in the figure) of the arena. <br>2.  The bot now has an algorithm to find its path to reach ‘End’ and the bot can store the turns in its memory to explore the shortest path during the second part of the journey. <br>3.  There are no restrictions to cover all the checkpoints. <br>The second part is the 'Actual Run.' <br>1.  In this run, the bot has to restart from the ‘Start’ again and finds its way to the ‘End’ through the best possible path by owning the path that was stored in the first run. <br>2. The End Zone’ has a black box that indicates the end of the path for the bot. <br>3.  The checkpoints are shown in the figure. (There would not be any blue (colored)) <br>4.  circle in the arena as shown in the figure. They are used only for reference <br>5. Each checkpoint carries 25 Points. <br>6.  The number of checkpoints and their locations may vary in the actual arena. <br>A total of 4 minutes will be provided to complete the dry run. <br>A total of 3 minutes will be provided to complete the actual run. <br> If the bot takes more than 4 minutes to complete the dry run, then the extra time taken will be deducted from the timing of the actual run which is 3 minutes. <br><b>BOT SPECIFICATIONS:</b><br>1.  The autonomous bot must fit into the box of dimension 25cm X 25cm X 25cm (). <br>2. The Bot must be started individually by only one switch. However, a team may have an onboard switch for restart. This switch has to be shown to the organizer before the run. <br>3. The Bot must have a red LED which will glow once it reaches the end zone of the arena. <br>4.  During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena in any way. It is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing the arena. <br>5. Any bot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the discretion of the organizers. <br>6. The Bot must have an ‘on board’ power supply. <br>7. When using the electric power supply, the potential difference between any two points must not exceed 24 V at any point of time during the game. <br>8. The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more units. <br>9. All bots/units which are touching each other or are in the starting point will be considered as • one bot. <br>10. Bot cannot be constructed using ready-made ‘Lego kits’ or any ready-made mechanism. <br>11. But they can make use of readymade gear assemblies. <br>12.  Violating this clause will lead to disqualification of the team. <br><br><b>GAME RULES:</b><br>Teams will be given 1 minute for calibration. If any team is found to alter its code after depositing its bots, then it will be immediately disqualified from the competition. <br>1. They are however allowed to make any other hardware changes. <br>2. Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed. <br>3. When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed to touch the bot or enter the arena. <br>4. At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting point. Only 1 team members are allowed to be near the game field while starting the bot.<br>5. Run will start only when organizers give the signal. <br>6. The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction. <br>7. A total of 5 minutes and 30 seconds will be given. <br>The bot must finish the dry run and main run in that period only. Restarts <br>1. The participants are allowed to take a maximum of 3 restarts in the entire match. <br>2. If the bot takes a restart in the first part (Dry Run) of the competition, it has to start from the checkpoint. <br>3. Once Dry Run is completed by the bot, the team won’t be given any other chance for Dry Run.<br>4. If the bot takes a restart in the second part (Actual Run) of the competition, it has to start from the start zone of the arena. <br>5. The timer will not be set back to zero and will not be paused in any case. <br>6. During a restart, a contestant must not feed information about the arena to the bot. However, contestants are allowed to adjust sensors (gain, position etc.) and make hardware changes. <br>The contestant must not alter the bot in any manner that reduces its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed). The organizers reserve the right to arbitrate in such circumstances.<br><b>GENERAL RULES:</b><br>1.  Only 1 member of the team is allowed to handle the bot. <br>2. Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the arena other than the bot. <br>3. Laptops/personal computers are not allowed near the arena. Other Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. devices must be switched off. <br>4. The organizers hold the right to check for these devices and their usage and disqualify the team. <br>5.  The time measured by the organizers will be final and will be used for scoring of the teams. <br>6. Time measured by any contestant by any other means is not acceptable for scoring. <br>7.  In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizers' decision will be final and binding. <br>8.  The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams. <br>9. Only one team is allowed to be present during the run, other teams will have to stay outside the hall . No team is allowed to take photographs or record their run. <br>",

        "Great in strategic play ? Then you just landed at the right spot. Get ready with your cards to play with the right use of your elixir. Planting a bomb tower there? Maybe an inferno tower will do the trick. The ultimate goal, to bombard all the towers with all the characters you can play. Simple 1 v 1 with one winner at the end. Become a maniac with your favourites and claim the win.",

        "<b>RULES:</b><br>1. All the players who registered for the event will be invited to join either a WhatsApp group or a Discord server.<br>2. One hour prior to the start time of the tournament, players will be provided with the tournament id and password.<br>3. All of them should join the tournament and wait for the tournament to begin.<br>4. Failing to join the tournament will lead to disqualification.<br>5. The tournament will last for 1 hour. In this 1 hour, players should try to win a minimum number of 3 battles in which if they win they’ll be rewarded with points.<br>6. Players should be active during the tournament to ensure that they play as many matches as they want.<br>7. Players should ensure a reliable connection, dealing with any network issues is their responsibility.<br>8. If a player exited the tournament due to any reason, and he wants to join again then his previously scored points won’t be considered i.e. he should start from the beginning.<br>9. The results will be based on the final leaderboard of the tournament. In case there are players having the same position/rank, there will be a tiebreaker, most probably another tournament.<br>10. Number of rooms will be decided on the number of participants. Winners will then be decided upon number of wins and number of stars.<br><b>GAME SETTING:</b><br>1. Game mode : Normal Battle(1v1)<br>2.
